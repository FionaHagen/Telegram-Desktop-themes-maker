### A first try on creating a Useful theme maker for [Telegram.org](https://telegram.org/).
# Help, suggestions and questions are welcome.

The program is designed to work on you own server or **xampp** ( [xampp site](https://www.apachefriends.org/it/index.html) )

To use on your own server please doenload one of the releases (The last is better), and unzip on your server. Trying to run the master branch it's a very bad idea, it may contain bugs or non finished features.

We have a channel on Telegram for Updates, and comunicattions [thememaker](https://t.me/thememaker)
